Step 1: Row by row classification (fit model for each individual user)
- [X] : General Testing metrics (error, confusion matrix)
- [X] : Add Testing metrics split by gender
- [ ] : Implement cross validation
- [ ] : KMeans Approach
- [ ] : Logistic Regression
- [ ] : Logistic Regression with Regularization
- [ ] : Trees (with Pruning)
- [ ] : SVM (optimize parameters)
- [ ] : Neural Networks (if there is time)

Step 2: Add Data from similar users to reviewer data to increase training set size
- [ ] : Group users by clustering
- [ ] : Try all approaches above again

Step 3: Whatever else works
